## Project description

I used this to explain a talk in MelbJS titled Exploring the Event Loop: It feels parallel, but is actually sequential. It simulates the event loop using my beloved cat Loaf!

## How to view this project

Go to https://ikramsaedi.github.io/loaf-event-loop/

## When developing:

- To run this, open index.html in browser of choice. This is a super super simple developer environment!

- Use `yarn tsc -w`. This will build the code from TypeScript to JavaScript so that it can be served in the index.html file.
