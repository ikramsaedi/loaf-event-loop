## What this project is
I used this to explain a talk in MelbJS for exploring the event loop! It simulates the event loop using my beloved cat Loaf.

## To run this:

- Open index.html in browser of choice

## When developing:

- Use `yarn tsc -w`. This will build the code from TypeScript to JavaScript so that it can be served in the index.html file
